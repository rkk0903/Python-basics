        "\n",
        "  - An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine-readable instructions on the fly (without needing prior compilation). Unlike compiled languages (e.g., C++), Python code doesn’t need to be converted into an executable file before running—it’s executed directly by the interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "  How the Python Interpreter Works\n",
        " - reads Code → Processes each line sequentially.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Checks Syntax → Validates for errors (e.g., missing colons, incorrect indentation).\n",
        "\n",
        " - Converts to Bytecode → Translates Python code into an intermediate bytecode (.pyc files in __pycache__).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Executes Bytecode → Runs the bytecode in the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).\n",

        "\n",
        "- Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers. They define Python’s syntax and structure.\n",

        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Mutability in Python refers to the ability of an object to change its internal state or contents after it has been created. Based on mutability, Python objects are classified into two categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Mutable objects\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Immutable objects\n",
        "\n",
        "- Mutable Objects:\n",
        " - Mutable objects can be modified after they are created. Any changes made to such objects affect the original object itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Examples: list, set, dictionary (dict), bytearray\n",
        "\n",
        " - Explanation:\n",
        "When we modify a mutable object, the object’s memory address remains the same, and the changes are made in-place.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Immutable Objects:\n",
        " Immutable objects cannot be changed once they are created. Any operation that seems to modify the object actually creates a new object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Examples: int, float, str, tuple, bool, frozenset\n",
        "\n",
        " - Explanation:\n",
        "If an immutable object is altered, Python internally creates a new object with a different memory location, while the original object remains unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        " - In Python, lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed after creation. This flexibility makes them ideal for storing dynamic data. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be altered once defined. This immutability improves performance, reduces memory usage, and allows tuples to be hashable, making them usable as dictionary keys or set elements. The distinction supports Python’s design: use lists when data may change, and tuples when data should remain constant. Immutability also helps avoid accidental changes in code, ensuring data integrity, especially in functions, loops, or concurrent programming environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
        "    - In Python, the == operator is used to compare the values of two objects to check if they are equal. It evaluates whether the data contained in the two objects is the same, regardless of whether they are the same object in memory. This operator is typically used to compare the contents of lists, strings, numbers, and other data types.\n",
        "\n",
        " - The is operator, on the other hand, compares the identities of two objects, checking if they refer to the same object in memory. It evaluates whether both variables point to the exact same location in memory, not whether their values are the same.\n",
        "\n",
        " - This difference is crucial when working with mutable and immutable objects. For example, two lists with identical values may not be the same object, while two variables referencing the same list will have the same identity. Therefore, == checks value equality, while is checks identity equality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - In Python, logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions or conditions, and they evaluate to either True or False. There are three main logical operators:\n",
        "\n",
        " - (1)  and: This operator returns True if both conditions are True. If any condition is False, the result will be False.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example: a and b returns True if both a and b are True.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - (3)   or: This operator returns True if at least one of the conditions is True. If both are False, the result will be False.\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Example: a or b returns True if either a or b is True.\n",
        "\n",
        " - (5)  not: This operator reverses the boolean value of a condition. If the condition is True, it returns False, and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example: not a returns False if a is True.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type into another. This is necessary when performing operations on variables of different types or when ensuring data compatibility.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Types of Type Casting:\n",
        "Implicit Type Casting (Type Coercion):\n",
        "\n",
        " - This occurs automatically when Python converts a lower data type to a higher data type.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Python performs this type of casting when it's safe and required. For example, when an integer is combined with a float, Python automatically converts the integer to a float.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Explicit Type Casting:\n",
        "\n",
        " - This is when the programmer explicitly converts one data type to another using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "- Implicit and explicit type casting are two ways to convert data types in Python, but they differ in how the conversion occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Implicit Type Casting:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Definition: Implicit casting happens automatically when Python converts a lower-level data type (like int) to a higher-level data type (like float) without explicit instruction from the programmer.\n",
        "\n",
        " - When it happens: Python performs the conversion when it's safe and no data loss occurs. For example, when an integer is combined with a float, Python automatically converts the integer to a float.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-   The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. They enable the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a given condition is True or False.\n",
        "- Key Points:\n",
        " - Conditional statements control the flow of execution.\n",
        "\n",
        " - They help programs respond dynamically to different inputs or situations.\n",
        "\n",
        " - They are essential for decision-making in logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Main conditional statements in Python:\n",
        " - if – Executes a block of code if a condition is True.\n",
        "\n",
        " - elif (else if) – Checks another condition if the previous if was False.\n",
        "\n",
        " - else – Executes a block of code if none of the previous conditions are True.\n",
        "\n",
        "  \n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In Python, the elif statement is used to handle multiple conditions in decision-making. It stands for \"else if\" and comes after an initial if condition. When a program encounters an if-elif-else structure, it evaluates each condition one by one from top to bottom. If the if condition is False, Python checks the first elif condition. If that is also False, it checks the next elif, and so on. The first condition that evaluates to True will have its corresponding block of code executed. Once a True condition is found, the rest of the elif and else parts are skipped. If none of the if or elif conditions are true, then the else block (if provided) is executed. This structure allows for clean and readable multi-condition branching, making the program behave differently based on different inputs or scenarios. It’s useful for checking ranges, categories, or step-by-step conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        "  \n",
        "- In Python, for and while loops are used to repeat a block of code, but they differ in structure and usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known or definite. It is typically used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string, or a range of numbers. The loop automatically ends after the last item is processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown or indefinite, and the loop continues as long as a specified condition remains True. It is suitable for situations where the loop’s end depends on user input or changing conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop\n",
        "\n",
        "- A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and the loop needs to run based on a specific condition being true. One common scenario is a user authentication system where the program continues to prompt the user for a password until the correct one is entered.\n",
        "\n",
        " - For example, in a login system, you don't know how many times a user might enter the wrong password. Using a while loop, you can keep asking for input until the correct password is provided. This makes the while loop ideal for conditions where termination depends on user input, system state, or dynamic conditions, rather than a predetermined number of repetitions.\n",
        "\n",
        " - A for loop is better suited for iterating over known sequences like lists or ranges, but in situations requiring indefinite repetition based on logic, a while loop provides the necessary flexibility and control.\n",
